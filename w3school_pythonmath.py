# Python Math 

# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers 

# Built-in Math functions

# E.g. The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value is an iterable:
"""
x = min(5,10,25)
y = max(5,10,25)

print(x) 
print(y)
"""

# E.g. the abs() function returns the absolute(positive) value of the specified number: 
"""
print(abs(-7.25))
"""

# E.g. the pow(x,y) functions the value of x to the power of y
"""
print (pow(4,3))
"""

# The math module
 
# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions. 

# E.g. 
"""
import math 

print(math.sqrt(64))
"""

# E.g. the math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer and math.floor() rounds a number downward
"""
import math

print(math.ceil(1.4))
print(math.floor(1.4)) 
"""

# E.g. pi 
"""
import math 

print(math.pi)
"""
