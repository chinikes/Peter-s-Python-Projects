# Python PIP 

# PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. 
# Note - If you have Python version 3.4 or later, PIP is included by default. 

# A package contains all the files you need for a module. 

# E.g. Import and use "camelcase": 
"""
import camelcase 

c = camelcase.CamelCase() 

txt = "hello world" 

print(c.hump(txt))
